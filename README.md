# Creating games every day
All my projects, when released, will be free to play or use and open source.
## My private ideas
- 3D voxel game where you can add whatever you want without mods **(Currently working on)**
- Create a better version of game listed above on rust with infinite worlds and generation
- Terraria like game where you can add whatever you want without mods
- 2D top down game where you can build giant factories survive with your friends
- Minecraft screen saver better than minecraft's 2021 april fools
- Smart auto clicker that helps you double or triple the number of your clicks
- Beautiful speedrun timer with themes and full obs support
- Website that encrypts passwords and saves it as file or in browser
- Encrypted chat website (this is not your regular encrypted chat, my idea is much better than other chats)
